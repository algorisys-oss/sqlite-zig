# sqlite-zig

An incremental migration of [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) from C to
[Zig](https://ziglang.org). The goal is a Zig implementation of the SQLite
database engine that stays behaviorally compatible with upstream SQLite and
passes its test suite — reached **one module at a time**, never as a big-bang
rewrite.

> **Status:** Phase 1 — **90 modules ported to Zig**, including the whole active
> Linux engine: pager, B-tree, VDBE, the SQL compiler (tokenizer → parser glue →
> code generator → optimizer), the OS/VFS layer, and every active extension
> (R-Tree/Geopoly, Session, FTS3/4, **FTS5**, JSON). The Zig build compiles
> upstream SQLite **v3.54.0** into `libsqlite3.a` + the `sqlite3`/`sqlite-zig`
> CLI, gated by a green test step. Output is byte-identical to upstream C across
> the regression battery. The only `.c` files still compiled are non-portable for
> a Linux engine: the Lemon-generated `parse.c`/`opcodes.c` (we port from the
> generators, not the generated files), the Windows VFS, and flag-inactive
> alternates. See [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) and [plan.md](plan.md).

## How it works

SQLite is built from its individual C translation units (not the amalgamation),
so each file can be replaced independently. To port a module we add a Zig file
that exports the same C-ABI symbols and drop the corresponding `.c` — the rest
of the engine keeps linking against it unchanged. This lets a mixed C/Zig binary
build and pass tests at every step.

```
SQL → tokenizer → parser → code-gen → optimizer → VDBE → B-tree → pager → WAL → VFS
                         (porting proceeds bottom-up: VFS/storage first, SQL front-end last)
```

## Requirements

- **Zig** `0.17.0-dev.644+3de725074` (the build uses the module-based build API).
- A system **zlib** and **libm** (linked by the shell).
- Only to *regenerate* vendored sources from upstream: `tclsh`, `make`, a C
  compiler, and the upstream SQLite tree. Day-to-day building needs only Zig —
  the generated sources are vendored under [`vendor/`](vendor/).

## Build

```bash
zig build                      # static libsqlite3.a + sqlite3 shell  → zig-out/
zig build run                  # launch the interactive shell
zig-out/bin/sqlite3 :memory: "select sqlite_version();"
```

Build modes:

| Command | What it builds |
|---|---|
| `zig build` | **Split build** (default) — each C TU compiled separately; this is the mode that supports porting. |
| `zig build -Damalgamation=true` | Single-file amalgamation build — a fast sanity check; cannot be swapped file-by-file. |
| `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` | Optimized build (default is Debug). |

Artifacts land in `zig-out/bin/sqlite3`, `zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig`, and
`zig-out/lib/libsqlite3.a`.

### Command reference

Everything you can run, at a glance (details in the sections below):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `zig build` | Build `libsqlite3.a` + the `sqlite3`/`sqlite-zig` shell (split, ported-Zig). |
| `zig build -Damalgamation=true` | Build from the pure-C amalgamation (oracle for diffing). |
| `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` | Optimized build (default is Debug). |
| `zig build run` | Launch the interactive shell. |
| `zig build smoke` | Build + run a single query, assert exact output. |
| `zig build test` | **Functional regression battery** (must stay green). |
| `zig build sample` | Build + integrity-check the **seed** blog DB (`sampledata/blog.db`). |
| `zig build example` | **Interactive blog CRUD** REPL over `sampledata/blog.db`. |
| `tools/tcltest.sh --zig <suites>` | Upstream **TCL suite** against the Zig engine. |
| `zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig <db> "<sql>"` | Run SQL directly (the CLI shell). |

## Using the `sqlite-zig` executable

`zig build` installs the command-line shell under **two** names:
`zig-out/bin/sqlite3` and `zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig`. They are the same binary —
the standard SQLite shell linked against this project's ported-Zig
`libsqlite3.a` — so every query runs through the Zig engine. The `sqlite-zig`
name makes it obvious which build you are invoking next to a stock `sqlite3`.

```bash
# one-off query against an in-memory database
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig :memory: "select sqlite_version();"        # -> 3.54.0

# open (or create) a database file and run statements
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig blog.db "create table t(a,b); insert into t values(1,'x');"
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig blog.db "select * from t;"

# interactive shell — dot-commands work as in upstream
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig blog.db
sqlite> .tables
sqlite> .schema t
sqlite> .mode box
sqlite> select * from t;
sqlite> .quit

# read a SQL script
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig blog.db ".read schema.sql"

# pipe SQL in on stdin
echo "select count(*) from t;" | zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig blog.db

# `zig build run` launches the same shell interactively
zig build run
```

Files it writes are bit-for-bit standard SQLite databases — a stock `sqlite3`
can read a database created by `sqlite-zig` and vice-versa:

```bash
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig t.db "create table x(a); insert into x values(1),(2);"
sqlite3 t.db "select count(*) from x;"   # stock sqlite3 reads our file -> 2
```

## Examples & sample data

### Sample/seed database

[`sampledata/`](sampledata/) holds a real blog schema and seed data —
users / posts / comments / tags with relations, constraints, an index, a view,
triggers, and an FTS5 full-text index:

- [`blog_schema.sql`](sampledata/blog_schema.sql) — the schema (DDL + triggers + FTS5).
- [`blog_seed.sql`](sampledata/blog_seed.sql) — seed rows.

```bash
zig build sample     # run blog_build.zig: (re)create sampledata/blog.db from the
                     # .sql above via the Zig engine, then integrity-check it
```

`zig build sample` writes `sampledata/blog.db` and prints a couple of
verification queries (a view join + an FTS5 search + `PRAGMA integrity_check`).
Open the result with either shell:

```bash
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig sampledata/blog.db ".tables"
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig sampledata/blog.db "SELECT * FROM v_post_summary;"
```

You can also build a database by hand from the SQL files:

```bash
zig-out/bin/sqlite-zig myblog.db ".read sampledata/blog_schema.sql" ".read sampledata/blog_seed.sql"
```

### Example programs — [`examples/`](examples/)

Standalone Zig programs that drive the ported engine through the C API. The
headline one is an interactive blog **CRUD** terminal (FTS5 search, `snippet`,
triggers, foreign-key cascades):

```bash
zig build example                       # interactive CRUD REPL over sampledata/blog.db
BLOG_DB=myblog.db zig-out/bin/blog_crud # ...or point it at another database file
```

Inside the REPL: `list`, `add`, `view <id>`, `edit <id>`, `publish <id>`,
`delete <id>`, `search <text>`, `help`, `quit`. See
[examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for the full command list and a sample
session.

## How to verify / test

### 1. Quick gate (what CI / every port must keep green)

```bash
zig build test
```

Runs the functional regression battery in
[`test/functional.sql`](test/functional.sql) and compares output byte-for-byte
against [`test/functional.expected`](test/functional.expected). It exercises
core DML, the index/WHERE optimizer, transaction rollback, joins, triggers,
math functions, JSON, FTS5 full-text search, and the R-Tree spatial index.
**Exit code 0 = pass.** Run it in both modes to be sure:

```bash
zig build test                       # split build
zig build test -Damalgamation=true   # amalgamation build
```

### 2. One-line smoke check

```bash
zig build smoke      # builds, runs a single query, asserts the exact output
```

### 3. Manual / interactive verification

```bash
zig-out/bin/sqlite3 :memory: ".read test/functional.sql"   # see the battery output
zig-out/bin/sqlite3 mydb.db                                # open a real database file
zig-out/bin/sqlite3 :memory: "select sqlite_version();"    # should print 3.54.0
```

Round-trip compatibility with stock SQLite (the on-disk format must match):

```bash
zig-out/bin/sqlite3 t.db "create table x(a); insert into x values(1),(2);"
sqlite3 t.db "select count(*) from x;"   # stock sqlite3 reads our file → 2
```

### 4. Updating the test battery

When a change alters expected output (or you add cases), regenerate the golden
file:

```bash
zig-out/bin/sqlite3 :memory: ".read test/functional.sql" > test/functional.expected
```

### Upstream TCL testfixture suite

SQLite's own test suite (the authoritative spec) runs through `testfixture` (a
TCL interpreter + the library + test extensions). It's wired here via vendored
TCL 8.6 headers (`vendor/tcl/`) + the system `libtcl8.6` — no `tcl-dev` package
needed, and the upstream tree stays untouched:

```bash
tools/tcltest.sh                                   # baseline: upstream C, sample set
tools/tcltest.sh --zig                             # same, but our Zig ports linked in
tools/tcltest.sh --zig fts5simple fts5aa fts5ab    # named suites (batch them — see below)
```

`--zig` builds `testfixture_zig` by replaying SQLite's own link command with each
`src/<m>.zig` object swapped in for its `.c`, so the suites assert against the
ported engine. Suite names resolve in `test/` and the extension test dirs
(`ext/fts5/test`, `ext/rtree`, `ext/session`, `ext/rbu`, `ext/fts3`). Each run
relinks `testfixture_zig`, so **pass several names in one invocation**.

Current FTS5 results against `testfixture_zig` — **~3,139 assertions, 0 errors**
(fts5simple/aa/ab/ac, delete, merge, rowid, integrity, rank, prefix, update).

See **[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)** for the full validation strategy (the
three layers, the differential-vs-C method, how the `--zig` swap works, and the
recurring C→Zig bug patterns the suites catch).

## License

SQLite is in the **public domain**; this port carries no license headers and
preserves the upstream blessing comments. This is a downstream experiment, not
an upstreamable SQLite contribution (upstream does not accept agentic code).
